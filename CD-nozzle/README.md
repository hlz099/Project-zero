The program works by computing the flow using the one dimensional equations for the isentropic flow of a perfect gas, and the Rankine Hugoniot relations for normal shock waves in perfect gases. 
You can learn about these relations by reading, for example, Modern Compressible Flow, 3rd Edition, 2003, by John D. Anderson Jr. 
You can use the Compressible Aerodynamics Calculator to help you use these relations in your own calculations.
