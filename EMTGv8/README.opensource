Welcome to EMTGv8 Open Source Release
README.opensource file compiled by Jacob Englander 1-13-2014

This package contains all of the code that NASA GSFC is releasing for the Evolutionary Mission Trajectory Generator, version 8. No third-party code is included in this release. As a result, the user will need to assemble some third-party components. These are:
-Boost C++ Extensions, version 1.41 or better (recommend version 1.51 or better)
-CSPICE ephemeris library, available from http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/ (place in cspice placeholder directory)
-leap seconds kernel "naif0009.tls" available from http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/ (place in Universe/ephemeris_files)
-reference frame kernel "pck00010.tpc" available from http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/ (place in Universe/ephemeris_files)
-SNOPT library, must be purchased from http://www.sbsi-sol-optimize.com/asp/sol_product_snopt.htm and placed in snopt placeholder directory
-VCf2c or the appropriate f2c for your operating system, also placed in the snopt directory. f2c ships with SNOPT

In addition, the MGA and MGA-DSM modes will NOT work without a suitable Lambert solver. A Lambert solver is not distributed in this package. You can feel free to add your own though. Consider the MGA and MGA-DSM modes to be "use at your own risk."

You will want to download SPICE ephemeris files for the bodies that you are visiting. I recommend downloading the full 3+ GB set from http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/ and placing it in your Universe/ephemeris_files folder

Finally you will need to add the following lines to your snoptproblem.h file after "void GetStates...":

integer getInform();

and the following lines to the bottom of your snoptproblem.cc file:

integer snoptProblem::getInform() 
{
	return inform;
}
