The TLNS3D code was developed to solve Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
Equations to simulate turbulent, viscous flows over three-dimensional
configurations. A general multiblock grid approach is used to model
complex configurations.  A multi-stage Runge-Kutta pseudo-time stepping
scheme is coupled with residual smoothing and multigrid acceleration
techniques to form an efficient algorithm for solving transonic viscous
flows over aerodynamic configurations of practical interest.
