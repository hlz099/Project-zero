1. The source code is provided in dir named "TLNS3D-std-source"
   To create an executable on Linux machines with intel compiler,
   use the following command in source directory:
         make lib mb mpi (creates tlns3dmpi in current directory)
   Note: tlns3dmpi is a parlallel version of execuatble requiring  mpi libraries
         tlns3dmb  is an in-core version of executable, which does not need mpi libraries
2. To run the code, use the commands
         ./tlns3dmb < tlns3d-input-file > output-file
         or
         mpiexec -np ncores ./tlns3dmpi < tlns3d-input-file > output-file
   where, ncores is the number of cores/processors used for running
          ncore should be l.e. number of blocks in the grid for a given test case
3. Note: tlns3d-input-file is an ascii input file used to specify the choice of
         solver parameters. It also specified the names of grid, map (connectivity),
         restart and several other output files 
   Note: tlns3d.inp_description file describes the various input parameters
         for flow solver

4. The connectivity and boundary condition information required by the solver is
   provided by a map file (name specified by tlns3d-input-file)
   Note: tlna3d.map_description file describes the functionality of various parameters
         that specify the boundary condition and connectivity information

5. Some sample test cases are provided in a dir named "Test_cases"
